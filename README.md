## Lessons Learned

Building this project I learned about how to manipulate the DOM using javascript and creating GUI using css,js and html. 
I made sure to make the game fun and simple to play. During the build whenever I got stuck I learned to take breaks and refresh
my mind. I also learned commit early and often. Overall it was a fun project but challenging.
